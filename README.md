# HooBank_React
## Banking Landing page built following JavaScript Mastery using TailWind CSS, React, and JSX.

This was an instructional project I completed to learn how to better use re-usable CSS classnames & TailWind within React.
This also gave me a better understanding of proper folder structure and component use in React.
